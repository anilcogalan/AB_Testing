## Business Problem

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, "average bidding", as an alternative to the existing bidding type called "maximumbidding". One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to do an EU test to see if averagebidding converts more than maximumbidding. The EU test has been going on for 1 month and mewnorld.com now asks you to analyze the results of this EU test. The ultimate success criterion for Bombambomba.com is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on Purchasemetric for statistical testing.


## Dataset Story

In this data set, which includes the website information of a company, there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here. There are two separate data sets, the Control and Test group. These datasets are in separate sheets of the ab_testing.xlsx excel. Maximum Bidding was applied to the control group and AverageBidding was applied to the test group. 

``` 
# impression: Number of ad views 

# Click: Number of clicks on the displayed ad 

# Purchase: Number of products purchased after the ads clicked 

# Earning: Earnings after purchased products

```
